## Bio

Philip Rosedale created an innovative Internet video conferencing product (called "FreeVue"), which was later acquired by RealNetworks where (in 1996) he went on to become Vice President and CTO. In 1999, Rosedale left RealNetworks and founded Linden Lab. There he led the creation of a virtual civilization called Second Life, fulfilling his lifelong dream of an open-ended, Internet-connected virtual world. In 2010, he co-founded LoveMachine (www.lovemachineinc.com) as a lab to build several new ideas at the edge of work, computing, commerce, and intelligence. Out of this work, grew Worklist, a global community of web developers, and Coffee & Power. In November, 2011, Rosedale released Coffee & Power, a site that enabled people to connect for small jobs and services using a free-market system and distributed work principles. At the beginning of 2013, the team at Coffee & Power became a new company: High Fidelity, and are currently working on the prototype stages of a new global virtual world.
